        <h2>On the graph</h2>
        <p>The graph represents the share price of the 5 assets of the portfolio on a 100 basis and on 5 years.</p>
        <p>Amazon’s share price is higher than the other 4 assets but more volatile too. Between the middle of 2018 and 2019, the price dropped from around 480 to 310. More recently, due to the coronavirus crisis in March 2020, the price dropped from 500 to 390 but rose quickly one month later to obtain a price above 550.</p>
        <p>The price of the 4 other assets has been around the 100 basis for 5 years with few fluctuations. As Amazon’s share price, the price of the 4 other assets declined in March 2020 because of the health crisis but in a more moderate proportion. The price gap was maximum 50 for Alstom and nearly 10 for Carrefour.</p>
