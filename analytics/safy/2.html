        <h2>Price stability until January 2020</h2>
        <p>The dynamic graph corresponds to the Alstom share price in dollars over 10 months.</p>
        <p>From July 2019 from January 2020, the share price was broadly stable. It was around $42 at the beginning and at the end of the period and fell to $37 during the period. The volume was low and stable until October 2019 and increased suddenly with more than 4 millions shares traded on the market. This can be explained by the fact that the fall in price gave the opportunity to investors to realize capital gain anticipating an increase in price. This is what happened between January and February 2020. The price increased to reach $50.</p>

        <h2>Coronavirus crisis</h2>
        <p>However, the price fell quickly in March 2020, caused by the coronavirus crisis, to reach $30, the lower level over 10 months. This fall was explained by people, who sold their shares in the panic for fear of a bigger drop in the future. The volume remained rather low and stable.</p>
