        <h2>On the graph</h2>
        <p>During the July 2019 until February 2020, the stock price of Airbus was not really volatile, it goes up and down with an upper trend. It can be explained by the fact that economics results of AirBus was good and there were no big information about the company which influence the stock price. As there are not big news, the volume exchange was stable.</p>
        
        <h2>Coronavirus crisis</h2>
        <p>Nevertheless, once again, with coronavirus crisis the stock price of Airbus dropped a lot, and it is logical the number of fly decreased and Airbus are losing millions of Euros. As a consequence, people were feared and they sold their actions, thatâ€™s why the number of transactions decrease a lot and the number of transaction is still high because people are looking for new opportunities.</p>
