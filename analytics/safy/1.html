        <h2>On the graph</h2>
        <p>The static graph represents L’Oréal’s share price in dollars over one year. </p>
        <p>The graph shows several important fluctuations in the price but it remains above $230 for almost six months. Indeed, the price reached its highest level in January 2020 with $275 but fell to $250 a few days later. </p>
        <p>Rising above $270 at the end of February, the price fell sharply with the start of the coronavirus crisis to $205, a drop of $65. The fall in stocks was a widespread phenomenon on the stock markets and L'Oréal was not spared, in particular due to its activity sector located in cosmetics.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Finally, the expected rebound was faster. In April 2020, the share price rose $50 to reach $255. More recenlty, in the beginning of May 2020, the share price was $265, which is rather a high level compared to the price level over one year.</p>
