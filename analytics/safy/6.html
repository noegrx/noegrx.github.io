        <p>AMZN = Amazon</p>
        <p>ALO.PA = Alstom</p>
        <p>OR.PA = L'Oréal</p>
        <p>CA.PA = Carrefour</p>
        <p>VIV.PA = Vivendi</p>

        <h2>Analytics</h2>
        <p>Markowitz’s method suggests not to diversify the portfolio too much to obtain the most efficient portfolio.</p>
        <p>It should be optimal to invest only in 3 stocks in the portfolio, mainly in Amazon (67%) and a little in Alstom (18%) and L’Oréal (15%). Conversely, it is not optimal to invest in Carrefour and Vivendi stocks.</p>

        <h2>Value At Risk</h2>
        <iframe src="../../img/safy/c2-s18-1.html"></iframe>
        <p>Amazon has a lower VaR (95) and a higher price thanks to the current situation and this is the reason why we have to invest in mostly to obtain the optimal portfolio.</p>
        <p>L’Oréal has the same VaR but graphs show more fluctuations, so the investment is moderate in L’Oréal shares. </p>
        <p>However, Vivendi has the lowest VaR (90) but the share price is low and gradually declines, so we should not invest in.</p>
        <p>Carrefour has a high VaR of 100 and the price is under the 100 basis. It is preferable to not invest in.</p>
        <p>Alstom has the highest VaR (110) but the price remains stable and relatively high regarding the other assets. We can have this asset in our portfolio at a level of 18%.</p>
        <p>Indeed, this combination of stocks provides a maximum return for a minimum level of risk. </p>
