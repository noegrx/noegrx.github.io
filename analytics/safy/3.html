        <p>The Japanese candlesticks represents the Amazonâ€™s share price over the most 14 recent days. We can see, for everyday, the price at the opening, at the closing with the highest and lowest level. </p>

        <h2>Price increase</h2>
        <p>On May 4, May 6, May 8, May 11, May 13 and May 14, we can observe on the graph an increase in price in one day. For instance, the difference between the opening price (2,256) and the closing price (2,315) on May 4 was a gain of 59, which is the higher growth on this period.</p>

        <h2>Price decease</h2>
        <p>On May 1, May 5, May 7 and May 12, the graph shows a decrease in price. For instance, the most important fall took place on May 12 with an opening price at 2,411 and a closing price at 2,356, that is to say a drop of 55.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>We cannot conclude on the evolution trend of Amazon price in the future because the price alternates between raising and falling one day to another but globally, on this period there was an constant increase in the price with 2,336 in May 1 to 2,361 in May 14. Indeed, the company suffered from the coronavirus crisis in March 2020, but it had a quick and stable rebound, driven by the reopening of the warehouses and the behaviour of consumers, which promote online shopping in this time.</p>
